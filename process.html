        I ended up not following my plan at all. After several classes going through the PY4E course (I practiced some Python in VS Code) I decided that it would be better to just start working in Blender, as a lot of the concepts were things we'd already learned, and I wasn't sure how much more of the Python syntax I'd need to learn to be able to use it in Blender. I started watching and following tutorials and working on my animations while continuously watching tutorials when I got stuck (which was a lot). I don't think PY4E really came in handy for this——Pyret would have probably been enough for using Python in Blender, or at least I don't think I would have had much more difficulty than I did.
