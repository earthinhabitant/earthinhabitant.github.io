        <h1>Careers</h1>
        This skill will be useful for multimedia and animation careers, or pretty much any field that Blender is useful in (which is a lot), which I like because those careers are interesting to me. This project is of course also connected to any careers in which Python is useful, but I think most of my Python knowledge is still from Pyret and not this project.
