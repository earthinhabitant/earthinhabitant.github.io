        <h1>Project</h1>
        <h2>My initial description:</h2>
        This project focuses on the use of Python to perform and automate animation tasks in Blender. It will involve learning Python in general and learning to use it effectively in Blender to perform useful tasks. The use of Python will be built off of previous knowledge in Pyret, and much of the code will be based on making useful functions to perform tasks, which is key to previous learning in Pyret and Snap!. The use of code to create animations using 3D models also correlates with the drawing of shapes we’ve done in Snap.<br>

        I ended up making two animations that are mostly based on floating objects. I learned how to use Python to perform common tasks in Blender, mainly performing transformatons, keyframes, physics properties, shaders, and modifiers. My two animations are very different from the tutorials I watched, as most of them were only small tutorials for some of the aforementioned common tasks. <br>
        Connections can be drawn from this project to many things learnt in CS A. My previous knowledge in Pyret was very useful for doing Python, especially with all the functional programming we've done that is very useful in a software like Blender where functions are very useful. The use of code to create animations using 3D models also correlates with the drawing of shapes we’ve done in Snap. <br>
