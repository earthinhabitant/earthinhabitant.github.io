        This project was relatively successful. My goals were met, as I developed a good understanding of how Python can be used in Blender, and made two animations mainly using code. If I were to do the project again, I wouldn't have set the goal of making an animations solely using code, as there are a lot of things that are really better done manually. When making that animation (the one of the color shapes) a lot of the time was spent struggling with small technical problems like finding the right data path and executing tasks in the right context. Something that I could have set as a goal is to make an add-on or some sort of custom UI for user input, which I did sort of do in the shapes animation, but with variables instead.
